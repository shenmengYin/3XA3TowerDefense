\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
	This software testing is aimed to verify the functionality of the whole project, and to identify any potential bugs and malfunctions which may occur in program compilation and running time. By completing the test report, we would like to prove that our program for the project satisfies the original requirements specified in SRS.

	\subsection{Scope}
	This Test Report includes the results for testing all the major functionality and features specified in requirement documents. It includes a variety of test cases to ensure that the Tower Defense Game functions properly, including programming language syntax, game algorithms, user interface, animations and audios, and unit tests for each class and methods. A separate test for the whole program will also be included for integration testing.

\section{Changes Due to Testings}
\subsection{Game Logic and Algorithms}
No changes are made to game logic and algorithms on the back end, since they passed all the automated tests and manual tests we perform on the system.
\subsection{Graphical User Interface}
One minor tweak we performed on GUI is the color of texts on the main menu. According to our manual tests on main menu, the texts are having a similar color with its background. We changed the color to white, to separate the texts from backgrounds for better usability.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}
The tower defense development team, Group 30, has managed to cover over 90\% of all the code in this project in the tests. Referring to the traceability matrices above, all the modules and corresponding requirements are tested, with most of them tested more than once. This proves that almost all the code are been tested and verified.
